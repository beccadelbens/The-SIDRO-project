The project SIDRO aims at representing, through an ontology, the debates arising around the possible interpretations of symbolism in artworks.
The case study for the application of our work is the painting "Guernica" by Picasso, because of the presence of numerous symbols, objects of many studies, and also for its historic and politic implications, which have fostered the debates.
